In this article, we will show you how to use Nawcom Modcd 032 to install Mac OS X Snow Leopard on a PC. You will need the following items:
 
- A PC with an Intel or AMD processor, at least 2 GB of RAM, and a SATA hard drive.
- A Mac OS X Snow Leopard installation DVD or ISO image.
- A blank CD or DVD to burn the Nawcom Modcd 032 ISO image.
- A USB flash drive to create a Nawcom ModUSB installer.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download the Nawcom Modcd 032 ISO image from [here](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/26397-nawcom%C2%B4s-mod) [^1^] and burn it to a CD or DVD using your preferred software.
2. Download the Nawcom ModUSB package from [here](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/26397-nawcom%C2%B4s-mod) [^1^] and unzip it. Run the Nawcoms\_ModUSB.pkg file and follow the instructions to create a bootable USB installer with your Mac OS X Snow Leopard installation DVD or ISO image.
3. Insert the Nawcom Modcd 032 CD or DVD into your PC and boot from it. You should see a Chameleon boot menu with some options. Choose "Mac OS X Install DVD" and press Enter.
4. Wait for the Mac OS X installer to load. You may see some messages about missing kexts or drivers, but you can ignore them. When you reach the welcome screen, choose your language and click Next.
5. Go to Utilities > Disk Utility and format your hard drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with a GUID Partition Table. You can also create partitions if you want to dual-boot with another operating system. Close Disk Utility when done.
6. Select your hard drive as the destination for the installation and click Next. You can customize the installation by clicking Customize and selecting or deselecting the components you want. For example, you can uncheck "Additional Fonts" and "Language Translations" to save space. You can also check "Legacy Kernel" if you have an AMD processor.
7. Click Install and wait for the installation to complete. It may take some time depending on your hardware and internet speed. When it finishes, click Restart.
8. Remove the Nawcom Modcd 032 CD or DVD from your PC and insert the Nawcom ModUSB flash drive. Boot from it and choose your hard drive from the Chameleon boot menu. Press Enter to boot into Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
9. You should see a welcome video and a setup assistant. Follow the instructions to create your user account, set up your network, and register your Mac. You can also skip some steps if you want.
10. Congratulations! You have successfully installed Mac OS X Snow Leopard on your PC using Nawcom Modcd 032. You can now enjoy using your hackintosh as you would a real Mac.

Note: You may need to install some additional kexts or patches to enable full functionality of your hardware, such as graphics, sound, ethernet, wifi, etc. You can find them online or use tools like Multibeast or Kext Utility. You may also need to update your Chameleon bootloader or use another bootloader like Clover or OpenCore for better compatibility and stability.
